# About
This repo contains several short JavaScript files that contain a recursive function written to accomplish a single goal. These functions are solutions to exercises posed on [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/5422/js-interview-prep-recursion).

### sumRange.js
This function accepts a single integer as a parameter, and returns the sum of every integer between the one and the integer passed in (inclusive).

### power.js
This function accepts a natural integer base and a natural integer exponent, and returns (base^exponent).

### factorial.js
This function accepts a natural integer as a parameter, and returns the factorial.
